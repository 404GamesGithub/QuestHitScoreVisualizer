# QuestCountersPlus

This is an Oculus Quest port of the Hit Score Visualizer mod for Beat Saber. This is missing many features still because my C is shaky at best... This uses jakibaki's modloader, found here: https://github.com/jakibaki/beatsaber-hook

## Installation

I'll go over this at some point, it works as a standalone mod when added as a mod to emulamer's BeatOn repo (no link until a formal release).
